GNOME Radio
===========

Inspired by [radiotray](http://radiotray.sourceforge.net/),
**GNOME Radio** is online radio streaming player with minimum interface possible,
making it very straightforward to use.
Supports most media formats (based on [gstreamer libraries](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer-libs/html/gstreamer-libs.html))
and ASF, ASX, M3U, PLS, RAM playlist formats.

## Installation

Use [GNOME Shell extension website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1247/gnome-radio/).

## Prerequisites

[GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/) should be installed in all Linux distributions.

## Channels

Editing categories and channels is still work in progress (Channels tab in Preferences).
In the meantime you can set your channel list by editing `~/.gnome-radio@gnome-shell-exstensions.fffilo.github.com` json file.
If file does not exist just start any premade channel and file will be created.
